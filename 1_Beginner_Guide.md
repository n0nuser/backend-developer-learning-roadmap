  * [ ] 🟡⭐⭐ Relational Databases: Learn about relational databases and their principles.
  * [ ] 🟡⭐⭐ NoSQL Databases: Explore NoSQL databases and their principles.
* [ ] 🟡⭐⭐ **Database Design**: Learn about database design and normalization.
  * [ ] 🟢⭐ Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs): Learn how to create ERDs for database design.
  * [ ] 🟡⭐⭐ Database Normalization: Understand the importance of database normalization and how to normalize databases.
  * [ ] 🟡⭐ **Database Denormalization**: Understand database denormalization and its use cases.
  * [ ] 🟡⭐⭐ SQL and NoSQL: Understand the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases and when to use each.
  * [ ] 🟡⭐ ACID and CAP Theorem: Learn about the ACID properties of transactions and the CAP theorem.
* [ ] 🟡⭐⭐ **Relational Databases**:
  * [ ] 🟢⭐ SQLite

  * [ ] 🟢⭐ Apache Cassandra: Learn about distributed NoSQL databases and their principles.

## Version Control and Collaboration

* [ ] 🟢⭐⭐⭐ **Version Control**: Version control systems allow you to track changes to your code, collaborate with other developers, and revert back to previous versions of your code if necessary. Git is the most widely used version control system.
  * Understand the basic concepts of version control.
  * Install Git on your local machine.
  * Set up your first Git repository.
  * Learn the basic Git commands: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `status`, `log`.

## Python Knowledge
  
* [ ] 🟢⭐⭐⭐ **Core Python**: Master the basics of Python programming. This includes understanding variables, data types, operators, control flow, functions, and error handling.
* [ ] 🟡⭐⭐ **Environment Setup**: Set up your Python development environment. Python has several tools to help manage packages and dependencies. This includes virtual environments and package managers like pip. Here are some tools for creating isolated environments:
  * [ ] 🟢⭐ Venv: Python's built-in tool for creating virtual environments.
  * [ ] 🟢⭐ Poetry: A tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

## Web Services
  
* [ ] 🟡⭐⭐⭐ **APIs and Web Services**: APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, allow different software applications to communicate with each other. Web services are a type of API that operate over the web.
  * [ ] 🟢⭐ OpenAPI: The OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger) is a specification for building APIs. It provides a way to describe and document a RESTful API.
  * [ ] 🟡 GraphQL: An alternative to REST, GraphQL allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and the same structure of the data is returned from the server.
