# Backend Developer Learning Roadmap

This repository serves as a comprehensive learning roadmap for aspiring backend developers. It includes checklists covering general knowledge, best practices, Python proficiency, collaborative tools, and design principles. Use this roadmap to guide your learning journey, track your progress, and enhance your skills in backend development.

The repository is going to be updated as my knowledge about backend world improves.

Feel free to fork and customize this roadmap based on your preferences and career goals by forking this repository and editing the `README.md` file.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The repository contains:
>
> * A full reference of the contents a backend engineer might need to learn along its journey.
> * A beginner guide to foundational concepts and basic backend development skills.
> * An intermediate guide focusing on more advanced backend topics and specialized areas.
> * An advanced guide covering expert-level concepts, performance optimization, and architectural design considerations.
